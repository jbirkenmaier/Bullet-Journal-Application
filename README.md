In this project I am building an application to track my daily activities and chores. 

Current progress:

01.04.2024:
-Created an input window, to add activities 
-input can be entered either by pressing enter or by clicking on a corresponding button

--> Further goals: 
              -Create "class Activity" <br>
              -Create an input area so that users can input data<br>
              -Visually presenting the data given by the user using matplotlib <br>
              -storing the given data, so that the application can be used as a journal<br>

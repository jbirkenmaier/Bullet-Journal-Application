In this project I am building an application to track my daily activities and chores. <br>
Current progress: <br>

01.04.2024:<br>
-Created an input window, to add activities <br>
-input can be entered either by pressing enter or by clicking on a corresponding button <br>
-created "class Activity" <br>
-created the layout for integrating matplotlib <br>

02.04.2024:<br>
-Data can now be entered by the user <br>
-Data gets plotted and updated using the matplotlib library <br>

03.04.2024: <br>
-attempt to integrate the possibility to save and load data. I discovered that there are some issues about the structure of my code, especially with handeling the data. These will be resolved soon.

15.04.2024: <br>
-Saving and loading data is now possible. The entered data is stored automatically. The next feature I want to integrate will be the option to delete data.
-Temporarily removed the "Add activity" button as it seemed to cause some issues. 

Further goals: <br>
--> ~~storing the given data, so that the application can be used as a journal~~ <br>
--> Ability to delete past entrys <br>
--> Create nicer plots <br>
--> Ability to personalize the appearance by the user <br> 
--> Ability to set goals <br>
--> Ability to take journaling notes <br>
